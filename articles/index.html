            <h3>NOT FEELING GOOD ENOUGH?</h3>
            <p>Many people struggle with feelings that they are not good enough. 
                Our high-powered culture is competitive and encourages us to look outside 
                ourselves for our self-worth. Magazines show us the ideal body,
                 movies show us unrealistic love stories and television shows us all
                  of the things we could own, if only we had more money. On top of that, 
                  many of us carry trauma and internalized beliefs that create fears we may not even be aware of...</p>

                <h3>CHANGE YOUR MINDSET CHANGE YOUR FUTURE!</h3>
                <p>What would you do if you knew you could achieve success 
                    just by learning how to change your mindset? That’s what 
                    Josh Iris learned after working with a Results Coach.
                     As the president of an electric motor company, Josh was doing pretty 
                     well at balancing his work responsibilities with his personal life. 
                    But he knew there was more out there for him.</p>

                    <h3>GO ALL IN FOR LOVE</h3>
                    <p>When Ashley and Gary first attended Date With Destiny 5 years ago, 
                        they knew they wanted more. They wanted to once again feel the spark 
                        that had faded over time. They had, as so many couples do, settled into
                         the trap of “meeting in the middle” each 
                        taking 50% responsibility for the quality of their relationship.</p>
